## Description

The Unofficial Koding Docs are my little attempt at writing a series of
article<->video linked guides and tutorials focused around common problems
and new feature exploration. Want to contribute?

## What about kWiki?

The Koding wiki is great, but i was hoping to work with something fresh and
where i had total control over the content and posters. Wikis can be a bit
cluttered and I'm trying to make something a bit more coordinated and fluid.
If you think i am not, please
[tell me about it](https://github.com/leeolayvar/koding-unofficial/issues/new)
:)
