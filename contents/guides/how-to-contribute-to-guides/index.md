In this guide, we will get a bit meta and talk about how to write guides.
We'll cover the *"Mission Statement"* and the basic process of how to
Fork, Commit, and make a Pull Request on the official Koding Docs repo. Basic
understanding of Git will help **a lot**, but hopefully in this tutorial
you will gain the minimum required information to write a document about
something you are knowledgable in. So, lets get started!

## What you will need

### Knowledge

Knowledge of a topic to the extent that you are able to write a clear and
understandable tutorial on it. If applicable, you can even make a video for
it, but otherwise I *(Lee Olayvar)* will do my best to make videos for
all Guides.

### Markdown

Knowledge of the [Markdown Syntax][1]. The guides are all written in
Markdown, and are compiled to HTML with the [Wintersmith][2] project.

### Optional: Wintersmith

The actual site you see [here][0] is a static site compiled by
[Wintersmith][2]. You won't need to compile or anything, but you can install
it if you like. An installation of Wintersmith would allow you to preview
the rendered Markdown as you write, helping ensure formatting is as you expect.
Again, this is entirely optional. As long as your markdown is valid, you don't
need Wintersmith. For instructions on how to install & run Wintersmith,
[see below](#wintersmithinstallation).
