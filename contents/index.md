The Koding Unofficial Documentation is an ongoing effort to create a series
of guides that, when combined with the
[Koding Unofficial Wiki](https://github.com/leeolayvar/koding-unofficial/wiki),
provide a well rounded guide to making the best use of
[Koding](https://koding.com) as possible.
If you have any requests, issues, or something doesnâ€™t quite make sense
then please
[submit submit an issue](https://github.com/leeolayvar/koding-unofficial/issues/new)
and we can help the Koding community grow, *together*. :)

**Disclaimer**: I am a Koding user like any other, so i make no claims to know
any fancy tricks or in depth Linux solutions for your life. I am simply trying to
help in a place i think i can.
