The Koding Community Documentation is an ongoing effort to create a series
of guides that, when combined with the
[Koding Community Wiki](https://github.com/koding/docs/wiki),
provide a well rounded guide to making the best use of
[Koding](https://koding.com) as possible.
If you have any requests, issues, or something doesnâ€™t quite make sense
then please
[submit an issue](https://github.com/koding/docs/issues/new)
and we can help the Koding community grow, *together*. :)


**Disclaimer**: We are Koding users like any other, so there are no claims to
know any fancy tricks or in depth Linux solutions for your life. We are
simply trying to help in a place we think we can.
