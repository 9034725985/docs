#### Having Trouble, or Is Something Outdated?


Koding changes quite rapidly, so if one of these guides are outdated,
or if something just doesn't quite make sense to you, please
[submit an issue][1] on the matter. Doing this will help me keep these guides
up to date, and help any Koders using these guides after you. Thanks!
